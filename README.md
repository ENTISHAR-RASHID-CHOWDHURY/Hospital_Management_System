# Hospital Management System

A comprehensive, full-stack hospital management system built with **Flutter** (frontend) and **Node.js/Express** (backend), featuring PostgreSQL database integration, JWT authentication, and role-based access control.

## ⚠️ Implementation Status: IN PROGRESS

### Current state
The repository is actively developed and contains a Flutter frontend and a Node.js/TypeScript backend. The application implements authentication, role-based dashboards, appointment scheduling, patient management, prescriptions, pharmacy inventory, laboratory orders and results, billing, reporting, notifications, and developer/demo tools (including deterministic demo user names and mock API responses).

The codebase includes demo data seeding scripts and automated tests. Static analysis and test tools are available; run `flutter analyze` and `npx tsc --noEmit` locally to inspect issues.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Backend Server
```powershell
# Navigate to backend
cd hospital_backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start server
npm run dev
```

Backend will run on: http://localhost:3001

### 2. Start Frontend Application
```powershell
# Navigate to frontend
cd hospital_app

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

### 3. Seed Demo Data
```powershell
cd hospital_backend
npm run prisma:seed
```

This runs `prisma/seed.ts` (the same as `npx prisma db seed`; `npx prisma migrate reset` also runs it). It is safe to run more than once. It creates:
- The 10 roles (Super Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Pharmacist, Lab Technician, Billing Manager, Facility Manager, Accountant, Patient)
- Dashboard shortcuts for each role
- One demo login per role, marked as a demo account:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Super Admin | `admin@hospital.com` | `admin123` |
| Doctor | `doctor@hospital.com` | `doctor123` |
| Nurse | `nurse@hospital.com` | `nurse123` |
| Receptionist | `receptionist@hospital.com` | `receptionist123` |
| Pharmacist | `pharmacist@hospital.com` | `pharmacist123` |
| Lab Technician | `lab@hospital.com` | `lab123` |
| Billing Manager | `billing@hospital.com` | `billing123` |
| Facility Manager | `facility@hospital.com` | `facility123` |
| Accountant | `accountant@hospital.com` | `accountant123` |
| Patient | `patient@hospital.com` | `patient123` |

> ⚠️ These passwords are public. Only seed development and test databases, never production.

```bash
cd hospital_backend
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:
- **PostgreSQL** database on port 5432
- **Backend API** on port 3001

## Developer Mode 🛠️

Developer Mode lets a developer sign in as one of the seeded demo users to try the app in each role. It is **off by default**, only works outside production, and can only switch into demo accounts, never real ones.

### Enable It

1. In `hospital_backend/.env`:
   ```env
   DEVELOPER_MODE=true
   DEVELOPER_PHRASE=<a long random phrase of your choice>
   ```
   The server refuses to start with `DEVELOPER_MODE=true` when `NODE_ENV=production`, and rejects placeholder phrases.
2. Seed the database (`npm run prisma:seed`) so the demo accounts exist.
3. Run the app with the same phrase:
   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define=DEVELOPER_PHRASE=<the same phrase>
   ```
   Builds without it show "Developer tools are not enabled in this build".

### Workflow

```
1. Click "Enter Developer Mode" on the login screen
2. Enter your DEVELOPER_PHRASE
3. Create or log in to a developer account
4. Pick a role, then a demo user for that role
5. Use the app as that user (real tokens, real permissions)
6. Switch to another role or log out
```

### API Endpoints

Only exist when `DEVELOPER_MODE=true`. Every request needs the phrase in the `x-developer-phrase` header; all but account creation and login also need a developer token (`Authorization: Bearer ...`).

- `POST /api/developer/accounts/create` - Create a developer account
- `POST /api/developer/auth/login` - Developer login (returns a developer token)
- `POST /api/developer/auth/logout` - Developer logout
- `GET /api/developer/accounts` - List developer accounts
- `DELETE /api/developer/accounts/:id` - Delete a developer account
- `GET /api/developer/demo-users/:role` - Demo users for a role
- `POST /api/developer/role/select` - Sign in as a demo user; returns normal access/refresh tokens for that user
- `GET /api/developer/session` - The role and demo user currently selected

### How It Is Kept Safe

- Off unless `DEVELOPER_MODE=true`; never allowed in production
- The phrase lives in your `.env` and build settings, not in the code
- Developer accounts are stored separately (`DeveloperAccount` table) and use their own token type, which the hospital API rejects
- Only users marked as demo accounts (`User.isDemo`, set by the seed) can be impersonated
- Every switch into a demo user is written to the audit log (`DEVELOPER_IMPERSONATION`)
